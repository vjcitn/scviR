Description: This package defines interfaces from R to scvi-tools.  A
	vignette works through the totalVI tutorial for analyzing CITE-seq
	data.  Another vignette compares outputs of Chapter 12 of the
	OSCA book with analogous outputs based on totalVI quantifications.
	Future work will address other components of scvi-tools, with a 
	focus on building understanding of probabilistic methods based
	on variational autoencoders.
