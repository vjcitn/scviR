\description{
grab scvi-tools muon-oriented VAE instance built on 
the PBMC datasets following the tutorial
}
\note{
VAE construction followed tutorial at
`https://docs.scvi-tools.org/en/stable/tutorials/notebooks/totalVI.html`.

We are using the scvi tutorial read early may 2025.  The
notebook uses "h5 format of single-cell multiomic data generated 
by Proteintech Genomics ...
The data is from human resting PBMCs 
stained with the MultiProÂ® Human Discovery 
Panel (HDP) followed by processing using 10x Genomics 
Flex chemistry with Feature Barcoding Technology."

It may be advantageous to set `options(timeout=3600)` or to allow an even greater
time for internet downloads, if working at a relatively slow network connection.
